This program implements a highly efficient calculating engine for
a pocket calculator. It includes a complete test rig to demonstrate
that the engine works as it should.

23: It is supposed to give 7 instead of 3
24: No, it does not give the same resutlts.
25: Yes, why does the reset method doesn't work properly?
28: It appears as if the clear method does not properly reset the
previousOperator field.
30: the result should be 6. The engine appears to behave correctly because it
leaves the correct answer, being 6.
